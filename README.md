# NBA-Player-Cluster-Analysis
This notebook will perform some clusternig analysis on an NBA players dataset form basketballreference.com (2017-18 season) - Topics covered will include principal component analysis and the k-means clustering algorithm.

The end output will be a tableau dashboard that looks at the most successful teams in the NBA, and who makes up those teams. Is there a correct number of superstars, all-stars, and roll-players? That's what I'll be searching for.
